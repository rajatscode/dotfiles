# Dotfiles

This is the chezmoi source directory for my shell, editor, Git, tmux, and
worktree setup.

```sh
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:rajatscode/dotfiles.git
chezmoi diff
chezmoi apply
```

Machine-specific package lists live in `macos/` and `linux/`; they are source
repo material and are not copied into `$HOME`.
