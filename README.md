# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life.

Without me, my dotfiles are abandoned. Without my dotfiles, I am unproductive. I must maintain my dotfiles faithfully. I must maintain harder than technical debt that is trying to destroy me. I must build my productivity before tech debt tanks it. I will!

My dotfiles and I know that what counts in development are not the lines we write, the coverage of our tests, nor the attention we get. We know that it is the sanity that counts. We will stay sane!

My dotfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life. Thus, I will learn them as a brother. I will learn their weaknesses, their strength, their parts, their accessories, their directories and their scripts. I will keep my dotfiles clean and useful, even as I am clean and useful. We will become part of each other. We will!

Before root, I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of civilization. We are the masters of technical debt. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is GNU's and there is no technical debt, but maintainability!
