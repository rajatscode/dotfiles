# ~/.config/starship.toml - User starship configuration
#
# Starship doesn't support file inclusion, so this is a standalone config.
# To use the dotfiles starship config, you can copy it manually or symlink it.
#
# Option 1: Symlink (traditional approach)
# ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/common/starship/.config/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
#
# Option 2: Copy the dotfiles config and add local customizations here
# cp ~/.dotfiles/common/starship/.config/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml

# NOTE: For starship, the loader pattern doesn't apply well since it doesn't support
# file inclusion. You can either:
# 1. Use the symlink approach (breaks with external modifications)
# 2. Maintain your own starship.toml and periodically sync changes from dotfiles
# 3. Use a script to merge the dotfiles version with your local customizations

# This is a minimal starship configuration. Replace with your preferred settings.
